# Personal Portfolio Website
## Tech Stack - MERN [![MERNStack](https://skills.thijs.gg/icons?i=mongodb,react,nodejs)](https://skills.thijs.gg)
Having never used these tools before, my goal for this project is to learn a new industry-relevant tech stack to build a personal portfolio website. This README serves as an archive of my learning through this project in order to document my successes (and failures) as I take on a new challenge!

## Learning Notes
### MongoDB
1. MongoDB is a NoSQL database, which can be more flexible than relational DBs by using collections and documents rather than tables and records

### Express.js

### React.js

### Node.js
